### Stata Intro 

- About: 

Stata is a general-purpose statistical software package. Most of its users work in research, especially in the fields of economics, sociology, political science, biomedicine, and epidemiology. 

- Version Selection:

Currently, there are three versions for Stata: IC, SE, and MP. Generally speaking, for this class, SE is fine. However, when you move on to your own research/dissertation, you may want to select the MP. The differences can be found [here](https://www.stata.com/order/new/edu/gradplans/student-pricing/).

### Resources

I understand that some of you may have no prior experience with Stata. Here, I list a few resources that can help you get started and improve your skills with this software. Most of the issues you encounter can be found online. So I encourage you to maximize the resources and resolve the problems on your own.

- Stata help file 

Simply type the "help" command, for example, you want to know the usage of "sum", you can type in the command box:
```
help sum
```
then a dialogue box will pop up for the help file.

- Statalist

A Stata User forum.

### Coding Styles

As a statistical software, Stata does not have a general recommended coding styles like R or Python. However, good coding behaviors can make your research much more accessible and understandable by readers/co-authors.



### Problem Sets Submission

Submissions consist of do file, log file, response file.

- do file

I believe you know how to create a new do file by using the software. One thing needed to mention is that you should make sure your codes are well annotated so that I can understand what you are doing. You may lose points if you do not make notes to your codes, even if the codes run correctly.

- log file

Check the Stata help file on how to create log file. It should be in your do file, which looks like this:
```
log using test, replace
***
***
***
log close
```
It is OK to submit .txt,.smcl, .log file (you do not need to convert to a pdf file). However, .doc/.docx file is not an option.

- Response file

Your responses to the questions are in this file. You can submit .doc/.docx/.pdf files. I encourage you to use LaTex to write the ducuments since it will be your "friend" in your Ph.D. training. Please note, if you are writing with LaTex, you only need to submit a generated pdf file and do not submit the source file. If you have questions regarding Latex, feel free to let me know. I can help you with that.
